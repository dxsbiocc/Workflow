name: HicExplorer hicPlotDistVsCounts
description: |
  This program creates distance vs. Hi-C counts plots. It can use several 
  matrix files to compare them at once. If the â€“perchr option is given, 
  each chromosome is plotted independently. When plotting multiple matrices, 
  denser matrices are scaled down to match the sum of the smallest matrix.
