name: deepTools computeMatrix
description: >
  Tool for the analysis and visualization of sample correlations based on the output of 
  multiBamSummary or multiBigwigSummary. Pearson or Spearman methods are available to 
  compute correlation coefficients. Results can be saved as multiple scatter plots depicting 
  the pairwise correlations or as a clustered heatmap, where the colors represent the 
  correlation coefficients and the clusters are constructed using complete linkage. Optionally, 
  the values can be saved as tables, too.
