description: |
  This program converts the SAM/BAM/CRAM file generated by user's aligner into a BAM file which 
  RSEM can process. However, users should make sure their aligners use 'reference_name.idx.fa' 
  generated by 'rsem-prepare-reference' as their references and output header sections. After the 
  conversion, this program will call 'rsem-sam-validator' to validate the resulting BAM file.
authors:

input:
  - bam: BAM file with reads aligned to transcriptome
  - fq_one: FASTQ file of reads (read_1 for paired-end sequencing)
output:
  - genes_results: This file contains per-gene quantification data for the sample
  - isoforms_results: This file contains per-transcript quantification data for the sample

  * For more information, see https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM.
  * You do not need to run this script if `rsem-sam-validator' reports that your SAM/BAM/CRAM file is valid.
